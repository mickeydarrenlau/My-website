Welcome to my site.
I loved to code in my free time and this is my project page.

First Project

MC server starter (Spigot and BuildTools)

github link: [https://github.com/mickeydarrenlau/MC_Server_Starter]

Use the BuildTools option in the program then move the final jar to spigot to start the server.
